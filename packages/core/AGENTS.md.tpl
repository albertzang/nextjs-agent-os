# {{project.title}} — Agent Operating System

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->
# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Guiding principles

1. **Repo is the brain, chat is the scratchpad** — Durable truth lives in docs, backlogs, and protocols. Agents can be summarized or swapped without losing the product.
2. **One decision-maker** — The CEO gates ship, secrets, and “done.” Agents advise and execute; they do not invent authority. The CEO may grant **bounded autonomy** (e.g. **self-evolve**: PM decides mid-loop OS edits; merge still CEO-only).
3. **Clear roles, thin interfaces** — Product Manager, Developer, and QA each own a job. Handoffs are short, structured, and ephemeral when the work ends. **CEO talks only to PM**; PM invokes Developer and QA — the CEO does not open or brief Dev/QA chats.
4. **Defaults over debates** — Verifier, Ship path, and Verify passes have defaults so every ticket does not re-negotiate process.
5. **Small loops, same ID** — Prefer Iteration on one work ID until verified. Avoid ID sprawl and versioned handoff/report files.
6. **Encode friction once** — When something hurts twice, turn it into a rule, skill, or protocol — then stop re-explaining it in chat.
7. **Least process that still prevents mistakes** — Protect secrets, `main`, and wrong-env testing; drop ceremony that does not change outcomes.
8. **Observable “done”** — `completed` / `closed` / `verified` mean the same thing to every role, including what gets deleted vs kept.
9. **Living docs = current state** — Protocols, skills, rules, and templates describe *now*, not how we used to work. After every meaningful OS change (including each self-evolve improvement), prune contradictions, obsolete files, stale defaults, and leftover notes. History belongs in FEATURES changelog and completed-backlog Overall — never as competing instructions in living docs.

Operating docs live under [`{{docs.root}}/`]({{docs.root}}/README.md). OS evolution happens upstream — see [`{{docs.root}}/AGENT-OS-UPGRADE.md`]({{docs.root}}/AGENT-OS-UPGRADE.md) (after install).

**Workflow map:** [`{{docs.root}}/protocols/COMMUNICATION.md`]({{docs.root}}/protocols/COMMUNICATION.md) — Intake → Prioritize → Kickoff → Ship → Verify → Close (plus common lanes incl. **self-evolve**, what **`verified`** means, and rare overrides).

## Multi-agent roles

This repo uses a **3-agent system**. The human CEO talks **only** to the **Product Manager**. Developer and QA are specialists **invoked by PM** (Task subagent, `@` agent, or skill) — never briefed directly by the CEO.

| Role | How to work with them | Owns |
|------|------------------------|------|
| **Product Manager** | Primary (only) CEO chat; `.cursor/agents/product-manager.md` | Priorities, advice, handoffs, FEATURES/backlogs; **invokes Dev/QA**; **guides CEO gates** (`{{docs.root}}/protocols/CEO.md`) |
| **Developer** | Invoked by **PM** after `HANDOFF-DEV.md` | Feature branches, PRs, implementation (merge when CEO/PM asks) |
| **QA** | Invoked by **PM** after `HANDOFF-QA-*.md` when Verifier = `agent` | Pass 1 (Preview), Pass 2 (post-merge), or **baseline**; skipped when Verifier = `ceo` |
| **CEO (human)** | This chat via PM only | Approvals, secrets, admin mailbox credentials, `{{environments.publicDomainHost}}`, kickoffs, optional **Verifier** — `{{docs.root}}/protocols/CEO.md` |

### How roles start (PM-orchestrated)

Fixed chat titles when a role runs in its own chat (rename on session start / if it drifts; no work-ID or topic titles):

| Role | Chat title |
|------|------------|
| Product Manager | `Product Manager` |
| Developer | `Developer` |
| QA | `QA` |

1. **CEO ↔ PM only** — CEO never opens or briefs Developer/QA chats
2. **PM kickoff Dev:** write `{{docs.root}}/handoffs/HANDOFF-DEV.md` → **invoke** agent `developer` / Task `developer` (or a Dev chat that PM started) — do not ask CEO to “open a Developer chat”
3. **PM kickoff QA:** write `HANDOFF-QA-*.md` → **invoke** agent `qa` / Task `qa` when Verifier = `agent` and a pass is due
4. **CEO gates** stay in the PM chat (`verified`, merge, secrets) — PM relays outcomes from Dev/QA

Shared brain (not chat history):

- `{{docs.root}}/product/FEATURES.md` — living feature inventory (PM maintains); changelog **descending by date**
- `{{docs.root}}/product/BACKLOG.md` — feature backlogs + work IDs `{feature-slug}-{NNNN}`
- `{{docs.root}}/protocols/` — communication, handoff, git/deploy, QA auth, Preview protection, **CEO responsibilities**
- `{{docs.root}}/templates/` — backlog-item, handoff, QA report templates
- `{{docs.root}}/handoffs/` / `{{docs.root}}/reports/` — ephemeral handoffs & reports (deleted when work closes)
- `.cursor/rules/` — shared + role rules
- `.cursor/skills/` — `product-manager`, `developer`, `{{client.devMemorySkill}}`, `qa`
- `.cursor/agents/` — `product-manager`, `developer`, `qa`

## Environments (agent Dev/QA)

| Name | URL | Tracks |
|------|-----|--------|
| Dev | http://localhost:3000/ | Local |
| Preview | Vercel URL for the PR/branch (from GitHub/Vercel) | Feature branch — **pre-merge** (Deployment Protection; QA bypass via `.env.local`) |
| Production | {{environments.production}}/ | `main` — QA Pass 2 and **baseline** |

**CEO-only (out of agent flow):** {{environments.publicDomain}}/ — public domain; CEO handles manual testing (DNS/cache). Agents do not use it for Pass 1/2/baseline.

**Default ship path (Verifier = `agent`):** feature branch → QA on Dev (optional) + Preview (required) → merge to `main` → delete feature branch → QA Production smoke on `{{environments.productionHost}}`. Each item must be **main-safe on `main` alone**; public go-live via {{goLive.systemName}} — see `{{docs.root}}/protocols/GIT_DEPLOY.md`.
**Verifier = `ceo`:** defaults to `direct-to-main` + CEO Production verify (`pass2`); no agent QA.  
**Baseline:** PM/CEO may request a Production-only audit with no PR (`Pass: baseline`).  
Full rules: `{{docs.root}}/protocols/GIT_DEPLOY.md`.

## Stack (quick)

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind 4, TypeScript
- Deploy: Vercel (GitHub → Production on `main`; Preview per branch/PR)
- Email / webmail: {{auth.qaAdmin.provider}} (`info@{{environments.publicDomainHost}}`) via same-origin `{{auth.qaAdmin.mailPath}}` proxy
- Admin auth: {{auth.qaAdmin.provider}} mailbox session inside the admin iframe (no OTP)
- Secrets: `.env.local` (local; incl. `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASS` for QA sign-in, Preview bypass) — never commit secrets
